Help for Stata EDCM code
========================

This file contains information on how to use the Stata do files included under
EDCM/Stata in the github.com/f20/power-models code repository.

These files are designed to be used with Stata, a commercial software package
for statistical analysis (www.stata.com).

Part A.  Creating random data in .dta format to test EDCM models
-------

To create a set of random data for EDCM testing purposes using Stata:

Step A1.  In Stata, change directory to the "Random generator" subfolder within
the "Stata" folder.

Step A2.  Run the Prog_SimulateData.do file from the do file editor or give the
following command to Stata:

    run "Prog_SimulateData.do"

Step A3.  in Stata, change directory to where you want the data to be saved.

Step A4.  Give the following command to Stata:

    simulatedata

This will create a new folder containing a set of .dta files with the random
data.

--

Part B.  Using .dta data to create EDCM models
-------

To create EDCM models populated by the random data from Part A, using a shell
interpreter such as sh, bash, or cmd.exe, and Perl 5:

Step B1.  Set the current directory to the folder containing the .dta files
generated in Step A4.

Step B2.  Determine the path to the pmod.pl file on your system.  The pmod.pl
file is in the root folder of the power-models repository.  The code below
assumes that pmod.pl is in the current working directory, amend as necessary.

Step B3.  Give the following command to the shell interpreter:

    perl pmod.pl *.dta EDCM/Current/%-clean*.yml

This will generate for each company, a YML file containing the input data
extracted from the .dta files, and a Microsoft Excel workbook.  The Microsoft
Excel workbooks are usually saved in a newly created subfolder.

Part C.  Collating the results of a set of EDCM models
-------

To collate the results of a set of Microsoft Excel EDCM models, using Microsoft
Excel and Perl:

Step C1.  Open and save each Microsoft Excel file using Microsoft Excel or
compatible software. This is necessary to perform and record the calculations
specified in the spreadsheets.

Step C2.  Follow the same procedure as in steps B1 and B2 if necessary, then
give the following command to the shell interpreter:

    perl pmod.pl -sqlite subfolder_name/*.xls*

Step C3.  Give the following command to the shell interpreter:

    perl pmod.pl csv

This will create a series of folders with a name starting "CSV-", each
containing a compilation of the options, input data and results of the models in
comma separated variables (CSV) files.

Part D.  Checking the results of a set of EDCM models
-------

To check that the results are consistent with the input data in a collation from
Microsoft Excel EDCM models, using Stata:

Step D1.  In Stata, change directory to the "Stata" folder.

Step D2.  Run the Model.do file from the do file editor or give the following
command to Stata:

    run "Model.do"

Step D3.  In Stata, change directory to a folder containing CSV files as created
in Part C.

Step D4.  Give the following command to Stata:

    EDCMCombined

This will create two Stata log files, "Res4501.smcl" and "Res4601.smcl", which
list any tariffs/charges for which the Stata model does not agree with the
results from tables 4501 and 4601 of the spreadsheet models.

Step D5.  To view the results, give either of the following commands to Stata:

    view "Res4501.smcl"

    view "Res4601.smcl"
