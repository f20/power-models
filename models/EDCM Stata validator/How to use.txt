Part A.  Creating random data in CSV format to test EDCM models
-------

To create a set of random data for EDCM testing purposes, using Stata:

Step A1.  In Stata, change directory to the "EDCM Stata generator" folder.

Step A2.  Run the Prog_SimulateData.do file from the do file editor or give the
following command to Stata:

    run "Prog_SimulateData.do"

Step A3.  in Stata, change directory to where you want the data to be saved.

Step A4.  Give the following command to Stata:

    simulatedata

This will create a new folder containing a set of CSV files with the random data.

Part B.  Using CSV data to create EDCM models, and collating the results
-------

To create EDCM models populated by the random data from Part A, using a shell
interpreter such as sh, bash, or cmd.exe, Perl 5, and spreadsheet software:

Step B1.  Set the current directory to the folder containing the CSV files
generated in Step A4.

Step B2.  Determine the path to the pmod.pl file on your system.  The pmod.pl
file is in the root folder of the power-models repository.  The code below
assumes that pmod.pl is in the current working directory: amend as necessary.

Step B3.  If you do not use a Windows or Mac computer with Microsoft Excel 2010
or later, skip to step B4.

If you use a Windows or Mac computer with Microsoft Excel 2010 or later, give
the following command to the shell interpreter:

    perl pmod.pl -sqlite *.csv EDCM/2018-02-Baseline/%-clean*.yml

This will generate a Microsoft Excel workbook for each company, use Microsoft Excel
to calculate the workbooks, and extract results from the workbooks into a database.

If step B3 is successful, skip to step B7.

Step B4.  Give the following command to the shell interpreter:

    perl pmod.pl *.csv EDCM/2018-02-Baseline/%-clean*.yml

This will generate a Microsoft Excel workbook for each company.  The workbooks are
usually saved in a newly created subfolder.

Step B5.  Open and save each Microsoft Excel file using Microsoft Excel or
compatible software. This is necessary to perform and record the calculations
specified in the spreadsheets.

Step B6.  Follow the same procedure as in steps B1 and B2 if necessary, then
give the following command to the shell interpreter:

    perl pmod.pl -sqlite subfolder_name/*.xls*

Step B7.  Give the following command to the shell interpreter:

    perl pmod.pl csv

This will create a series of folders with a name starting "CSV-", each
containing a compilation of the options, input data and results of the models in
comma separated variables (CSV) files.

Part C.  Checking the results of a set of EDCM models
-------

To check that the Stata code gives the same results as the workbooks, using Stata:

Step C1.  In Stata, change directory to the "Stata" folder.

Step C2.  Run the Model.do file from the do file editor or give the following
command to Stata:

    run "Model.do"

Step C3.  In Stata, change directory to a folder containing CSV files as created
in Part C.

Step C4.  Give the following command to Stata:

    EDCMCombined

This will create two Stata log files, "Res4501.smcl" and "Res4601.smcl", which
list any tariffs/charges for which the Stata model does not agree with the
results from tables 4501 and 4601 of the spreadsheet models.

Step C5.  To view the results, give either of the following commands to Stata:

    view "Res4501.smcl"

    view "Res4601.smcl"
