This workbook is structured as a series of named and numbered tables. There is a list of tables below, with hyperlinks.  Above
each calculation table, there is a description of the calculations and hyperlinks to tables from which data are used. Hyperlinks
point to the relevant table column heading of the relevant table. Scrolling up or down is usually required after clicking a
hyperlink in order to bring the relevant data and/or headings into view. Some versions of Microsoft Excel can display a "Back"
button, which can be useful when using hyperlinks to navigate around the workbook.
